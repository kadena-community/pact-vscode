Pact is an open-source programming language for writing smart contracts.  
  
Itâ€™s designed from the ground up to support the unique challenges of developing solutions to run on a blockchain. Pact empowers developers to create robust and high-performance logic for transactions. It facilitates execution of mission-critical business operations quickly and effectively.  
  
Pact is designed with safety in mind. Its design is informed by existing approaches to smart contracts as well as stored procedure languages like SQL and LISP. Pact resembles a general-purpose, Turing-complete language. It includes LISP-like syntax, user functions, modules, and imperative style.
